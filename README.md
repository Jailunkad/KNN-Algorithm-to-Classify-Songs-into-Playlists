# KNN-Algorithm-to-Classify-Songs-into-Playlists
Compiled a dataset using peoples listening history and implemented feature engineering to clean and preprocess the data. Developed a machine learning model using the K Nearest Neighbour algorithm to analyse songs based on their musical attributes. The algorithm would then classify songs as a specific mood and return a brand new playlist
